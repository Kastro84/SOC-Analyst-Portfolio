# SOC Analyst Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of SOC-style investigations based on common security incidents such as phishing, identity misuse, endpoint alerts, and SIEM-related detections. Each project follows a clear investigation flow, documenting what triggered the review, what was checked, what was found, and how the incident was handled.

Projects are added over time and reflect a range of scenarios and complexity levels, with a focus on practical investigation work, decision-making, and documenting outcomes in a way that mirrors real SOC processes.
